    <span class="miniature">T</span> his is the personal webpage of WS George, penname of Jesse Johnson, a Ghanaian writer living in Accra. After an almost 10-year hiatus, Jesse has resumed his journey with creative writing. In over the last decade, he shifted his focus almost entirely to music (and writing about it), and pursuing a career.

    Most of WS George's writing will be found elsewhere, but links to those publications will be made available on this website. It will get overhauled eventually. He hopes.
