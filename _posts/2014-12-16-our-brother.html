<p class="content-text">
They found me adrift somewhere on the Volta <br>
dead, or asleep it is hard to tell: <br>
I do not speak that language anymore. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
My dreams are filled <br>
with the Gospel and cheese; <br>
The angels are white and Heaven is cold; <br>
Some said Winter had come early. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
“Wait for Spring to shed  your old clothes, <br>
then frolick with us in the wild…” <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
They dragged me onto a bed of reeds, <br>
among the crabs, school children <br> 
(by their age, not uniforms) <br>
had come to see the spectacle. <br>
I heard them giggle, some circled me <br> 
and sang to wake me up, <br>
or mourn my death, it is hard to tell: <br> 
I do not speak that language anymore. <br>
</p>
