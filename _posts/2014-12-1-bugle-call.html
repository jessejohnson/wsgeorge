<p class="content-text">
	Because calling this "The Last Post" will be too overt.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Exactly ten hours ago, I was tingling all over. I could not keep still one moment. Too many things were racing in my mind. Most of them were about music. Music and verse. I was writing another essay, this time on the nature of beauty as I saw it in music and in poetry.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I had work to do; really important work to do. I needed to get an app running and talking to a remote server. I needed to flesh out an austere user interface, to make it something presentable for pitch practice. But some things mattered more than anything I was doing at that moment. The exploration of varying degrees of bliss has been my preoccupation these last few hours.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I started this afternoon by dropping hints in the introduction of the planned essay. Then I went deep into what joy Mozart's Sonata Facile brought me. That was when the fire lit. Throughout the day I was preoccupied with how I was going to bare my soul out to the world by sharing all those things that make me love my music and my poems. It was a good plan.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I indulged a bit too much, it turned out. I spent too long being pleased in the little fantasies I make myself. I had forgotten how cold and joyless everything really is.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Cold and joyless. That is how I meant to end that essay. I shared those things with you, those little jewels that make a cold and joyless world bearable. I really wanted to end the essay that way. It looks like it will be left half done - like so many things before it.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I have not slept tonight. Before I hit my bed, I stared at the laptop screen. I'd written a lot about my favourite hymn already; Jesus is God: the Solid Earth... It is beautiful. Remember me whenever you hear it. And make sure it is to the Ellacombe tune. That tune rocks!
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	But, after concluding the section on music (after which I was to begin an exploration of aesthetically pleasing sounds in language starting with the French dialect in which the original words of Pat-a-pan were written) I felt a familiar chill. The chill of emptiness. Feeling the world closing in on me again, I forced my mind to focus more on the good things in life. On more music.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I picked up my second favourite hymn, Praise to the Lord the Almighty. I sang one verse that reminds us that God "biddeth them cease, turneth their fury to peace", speaking about our storms. Our troubles. It lifted me up a bit.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	But, like all things good, the joy came to an end. Like all things promised, it failed. I teared up and eventually, cried a silent cry. It is too hard, too bloody hard.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	All this happened around 1:30am. I did not sleep last night. I could not sleep. My mind drifted from regret to regret, from failed attempt at extinguishing myself to failed attempt. I thought about my family. Hours earlier, in an inexplicable fit of joy I told them I had good news to give. I told them they will have to wait until Saturday when I get back home. I had good news indeed.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	One prominent poet and friend had given me confidence that a new project I was planning could be pulled off. I already stitched together a team, wrote a proposal, set plans in motion. I spoke to Cheryl of some major plans we had to make Ghanaian choral music more accessible to the world. She liked the idea. I loved it. Anything to bring me closer to music will be good. I had plans.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	The bell jar has descended.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I am not mad and incoherent. I am calm and collected. I have once more slipped into the numbness that I dread. I am a monster incarnate. I have risen from the abyss. I am destroying things as they come.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	The first casualty was the fragile peace with my roommate. Had he not relented, I was poised to flare up in destructive rage and hurt him and destroy things in the room because...because I am that monster. That same monster who, out of anger burned three years worth of poetry, stories, maps in the backyard. That monster who would stab a friend because he mocked him. That monster who will run from home. That monster who will harm himself in the hopes of escaping this world.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	He has returned and is as ruthless as he is methodical.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Whatever happens after this, know one thing. I will miss some people dearly. Ama and Jermaine especially. If I had any friends, these were the ones. They are good people. They deserve better than this.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	William. You must be tired of me. I'm also tired of myself. If there's anyone who's loved me as much as my father has, it is you. And as we've never met, that is saying something. My plan was to fly to South Africa for some business with Chillax. We were going to Joburg, then Capetown. I really want to see you. If I live through this, if the monster doesn't make this trip his prey, me may meet before the year is dead. Before I am. I will leave a small door open for you.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Daniel, maybe. Jerome, maybe. We had our dance together. The music has stopped now. They're packing the chairs. The lights are on. Can't you hear the cleaners sweeping the trash out?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I wish to name one more person but...memory is a fickle thing, old friend.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	It's been a thirll guys, and girls. But change is a thing we cannot escape. Let this remain our little secret, just you and I. When they come asking, pretend you never knew me. Or I'm dead. That will be harder, but you guys are creative. You can manage it. When I came in the world, I was just one more statistic. Only a +1. Let me slip out the backdoor silently, okay? Let's snuff out this flame and fan the smoke away. No one needs to know. After all, I won't even bump the yearly figures. Those estimates are huge. And life must go on.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I am not dead. I am only sleeping.
