	I risk condemning myself to Hell, if popular thought is anything to go by. If I were to go strictly according to the Bible, however, God has already abandoned me; his Holy Spirit is grieved, and I am beyond redemption. Whichever is the case, I feel it strongly necessary to put forward my thoughts concerning this tyrannical reign of God in my life, and in the lives of so many believers.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Very early in life, I was taught to ask God for things I wanted in life. Or pray to the Saints of various things, never mind the fact that said God was generally held to be all knowing, even knowing beforehand the things that we desired but acting according to his will regardless.

<p class="content-text">
	The year was 1998, or '99. I was in class two, preparing for my math exam. I had been given a key holder that had an image of the Virgin Mary printed on it. I wasn't a dunce. I was smart. I had studied hard for my papers. This math exam though was something different. I was drawn to the image of the Virgin and the thought that, being a good Catholic, I should pray to her for grace from God before I went to class to write. God will listen, I had been taught. My prayer will be answered.

<p class="content-text">
	It turned out my results in this math exam were my second worth in my academic history. I clocked 66 percent. I was ashamed. My brother was ashamed. How could I, who'd aced all papers the previous year bring home 66% on an exam sheet? I prayed to the Virgin for grace; had I not been heard? What happened?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	The experience has not been isolated. Throughout my life I have followed popular Christian thought and asked God for numerous favours, may of which have gone rudely unanswered. The most recent event was during a struggle with depression that saw me in hospital for three weeks. I begged God for help. I pleaded that he should take this thing away from me, spare me, forgive me, so I could live a normal life. He did not answer me. It was only after three months of struggling that a single phone call from a stranger lifted the bell jar from off my head and I could breathe freely.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	After needlessly prolonged suffering, was I to thank God for hearing me? Did he truly listen? Did he answer me? I think not!
</p>


<p class="content-text">
	I have since come to the conclusion that God does not interfere in our trivial lives. His chief concern is the redemption of the soul. Whatever happens on earth matters little, because it will all lead to death. What use is it to ask for a comfortable life from a God who repeatedly tells you that the next life is worth far more?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Probably Christians the world over a wrong about the way God relates to us. Probably they have invented this God who seeks our earthly wellbeing because they cannot face the harsh reality of a God more concerned about bringing us into his heavenly kingdom.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	It makes sense that God should not answer my prayers, and he should not deserve thanks for my own earthly triumphs. If God should be thanked, it is for his mercy and salvitic work, and not something as trivial as beating my depression.
