<h3 class="title-text text-center">Reflection on a Distant Body</h3>

<p class="content-text">
	<span class="miniature">I</span> wished the sun itself <br>
	mine, until <br>
	I saw it laugh, and <br>
	dance across the water <br>
	while the wind blew by <br>
	and wrinkled its mirror-face; <br>
	then I understood <br>
	how joy could not be cradled <br>
	in these leaky hands. <br>
</p>

<h3 class="title-text text-center">Dead &amp; Broken Things</h3>

<p class="content-text">
	<span class="miniature">Y</span>ou strike me <br>
	as bizarre: <br>
	not quite the powdered doll <br>
	but sometimes, yes. </p>

<p class="content-text">
	Not hoisted in the gibbet <br>
	of your sadness, yet <br>
	you flaunt the scars <br>
	when they refuse to hide behind <br>
	those layers of cosmetic joy: <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Perhaps you are <br>
	an amateur leaf descending, <br>
	and all the while<br>
	faltering as you fall down <br>
	a tumbling, windy blanket. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Or you are too ordinary; <br>
	a writhing stump <br>
	(that tripped me as I passed) <br>
	covered with fallen leaves <br>
</p>

<h3 class="title-text text-center">Pathos</h3>

<p class="content-text">
	<span class="miniature">T</span>he naked girl wiped semen <br>
	off her lower lip, <br>
	the man yanked his belt <br>
	and buckled. <br>
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	The naked girl smelled <br>
	her middle finger tip, <br>
	the man tied the laces <br>
	of his shoes. <br>
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	The naked girl twisted <br>
	a lock of her hair, <br>
	the man clipped on his watch <br>
	and checked the time. <br>
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	The naked girl sank low her head <br>
	and clapped her feet, <br>
	the man had closed the door. <br>
</p>
