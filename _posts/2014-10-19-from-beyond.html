<p class="content-text">	
I heard her voice <br>
and oh,<br>
there rang beneath <br>
well spoken lines<br>
the quaking of a soul<br>
alive and bound,<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
I did not know it then,<br>
but yet,<br>
she lived<br>
beyond the grave<br>
and said such things<br>
that left me<br>
mad, as mad as she.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
She flittered through<br>
the gates of hell,<br>
with tulips<br>
in her hand,<br>
a ghastly veil<br>
upon her face<br>
that hid the sinful sleep<br>
in which she lies.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
She loved me well<br>
and brief,<br>
and called me darling<br>
in a mockery of virtue<br>
soured by fever.<br>
Perhaps she thought she was<br>
some species<br>
of virgin come again,<br>
my own lady lazarus<br>
who stirs,<br>
who does not sleep.<br>
