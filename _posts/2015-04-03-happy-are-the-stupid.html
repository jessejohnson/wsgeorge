<p class="content-text">
If there's one thing Dostoyevsky taught me from his book Notes from the Underground, it is that stupid people have an unfair advantage when it comes to living happy, fulfilling lives.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
My little observation has confirmed this fact numerous times; that to be successful in the world as it is (here success is defined by happiness â€“ the abundance and persistence of joy and contentment) one must resign certain, if not most critical faculties.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
Momentary stupidity is a prerequisite for joy; that brief spasm of happiness. For this feeling to last longer than a moment, one must intentionally persist in that state of stupidity for as long as he desires. While this is nothing to be ashamed of, what bothers me most, I find, is most people do not resign their faculties intentionally. For them, it is their natural state to be stupid, therefore, to be happy.

	What proof have I of this? Let us see:
</p>

<h3 class="content-subtitle text-center">
Friendship
</h3>

<p class="content-text">
At the end of last year, I found myself with more spare time than I knew what to do with. I was locked up in a hospital, confined to some books, my thoughts and the Internet. Which meant I had everything I actually wanted in life with me. What did I do with that time alone? Well, I did a lot of learning. I soaked myself in educational videos and online courses, trying to keep my mind stimulated. Of the many things I stumbled upon, one that impressed me most was an edX course on Happiness. I took it because I was pathetic and unhappy. I needed to discover what secret normal people had that kept them cheerful everyday.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
That course on happiness is still ongoing. It may be about to end, I don't know. I've lost interest in it. I discovered what I wanted early on and did not need the gentle noob introductions to unfold this knowledge to me.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
The factors that bring happiness to one's life are few and rather obvious. Friendship and relationships with other people, altruistic empathy, and acceptance of life for what it is; imperfect. I may have found them already when I was discovering Epicurus. But I needed an entire course on edX to teach me these things explicitly.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
Maintaining friendships is a prerequisite for happiness. What does it mean to maintain a friendship? In my limited experience with friends (for, you see, I have had only a few throughout my life) communion can be maintained when each party operates on a similar wavelength. By wavelength, I mean thought patterns and intellect, demeanor, etc. There must be some resonance for constant communion to be even possible between two people.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
For friendship to exist and flourish, both parties must be alike in some fundamental way, and in all the ways in which these fundamental commonalities manifest themselves. They must agree with their minds; they must be friends at the subconscious level for anything that society calls friendship to be expected to exist at all.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
For the intelligent person, this is no mean feat. The odds of actually finding another individual who speaks ones same language are low. Statistics ensures that the outliers will always be an infinitesimal population. Even in a supposedly highly curated universe where people are selected based upon intellectual merit alone, there seems to be this phenomenon that guarantees that those who are in truth superior in their minds will always be the fewest among the group. And if that universal population were small enough, there will be a single outlier. Poor misfit.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
George Orwell seems to share the same view in his political books 1984 and Animal Farm. So too does Aldous Huxley when he considers his fantastically absurd Brave New World, and revisits it in more realistic terms. The masses are stupid. The intelligent belong to a smaller caste. Whereas in their dystopian worlds the intelligent were ruthless rulers, the underlying fact that they were outnumbered by the more foolish masses is still evident and relevant to this argument.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
Now, with such a small population to depend on for companionship, one cannot help but see how unlikely it is for the intelligent man to find himself as troubled as Adam must have been among lesser animals, without a suitable partner. Unless he brought himself to their level and became one with them, Adam, our paragon of intelligence, would have been the lonely, unhappy outlier that he was, save for God's supposed intervention.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
So, unable to find suitable friends, our intelligent man has two outcomes to choose from: to become stupid and so join the large brotherhood and share in their common joy, or to remain outside their circle and so embrace his unhappiness. In choosing the latter, he will be regarded as a mad failure in life, whereas the mass, defining the standard of success by their sheer numbers, will regard the other choice as saner, more natural, much better.
</p>

<h3 class="content-subtitle text-center">
Acceptance and Empathy
</h3>

<p class="content-text">
If there is one thing the intelligent man detests, it is the unintelligent. Lumped with that unpardonable throng is the unfinished, the unrefined, the crude, the imperfect. Yet it is continually preached to us night and day that we must, to be content in this world, accept that which is imperfect as perfectly natural.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
From my experience, those who are able to accept what is not well done are those predisposed to be mediocre in their thoughts and actions. They are the uncritical lot. In order for one to be more like them, one must necessarily ignore what his sharp mind rails against, just because society deems it good to ignore such.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
And who is he to have an independent mind when everything will go against him?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
The same goes for empathy, a necessary foundation for happiness. How can one empathize with another without becoming like him? Isn't it easier for the wiser to put down their wisdom to become like the fool, than for the fool to discover wisdom and become wise himself?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
If these arguments seem harsh, it is because they must be true. The herd is always happy. The wolf is always searching, never content.
</p>
