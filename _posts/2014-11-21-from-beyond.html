<p class="content-text">
I heard her speak <br>
with words which proved <br>
her frantic soul <br>
was held against her will. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
She crossed the threshold <br>
of her grave and said <br>
such things that left <br>
me mad, as mad as she <br>
had been. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
She fluttered above <br>
the gates of Hell <br>
with tulips in her hand, <br>
her ghastly face hid <br>
behind a veil, and sleep, <br>
a sinful sleep was in her eyes. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
She loved me well, she loved <br>
me briefly, called me “darling” <br>
and mocked me with her fevered virtue <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
Perhaps she thinks she is some species <br>
of virgin come to life again; <br>
my own lady Lazarus <br>
still stirs, still does not sleep. <br>
</p>
