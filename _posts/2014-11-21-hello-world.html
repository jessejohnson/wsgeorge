<p class="content-text">
	<span class="miniature">W</span>elcome to my blog.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	If you found this site, you may be wondering what happened to the five or so blogs I run on WordPress and Blogger. I've killed all of them and moved on, for several reasons.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	You will find all of my content here. The blog section is where, from time to time, I will share my thoughts on poetry and writing in general, as I used to do on SeriousPoetry. My poems, previously on my blogger site, will be published here.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I will create new sections of my site for the other kinds of post ~ short fiction, essays and a list of my published work.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I've got some content up already, so read through if you have the time.
