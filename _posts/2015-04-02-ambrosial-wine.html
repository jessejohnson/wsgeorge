<p class="content-text">	
I must have drunk too much ambrosial wine <br>
and fallen fast asleep, I must have dreamed: <br>
I walked among the clouds, God at my side <br>
an angel led with a lantern like a star <br>
and all the world was dark beneath my feet. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
Heaven was cold and void, an empty chapel <br>
that carried our footsteps through its <br>
vacant corridors, our voices echoed like <br>
the thousand ghosts that came for mass. <br>
The organ played itself, the windows smoked <br>
with incense as prayers rise from purgatory; <br>
It was a requiem for my soul, God said. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
I heard the music rise serpentine <br>
from the depths of silence <br>
and tickle the tongues of all the bells, <br>
the brass sang with the voices of angels, <br>
the stained glass choirs themselves rejoiced <br>
as all the world that slept beneath my feet <br>
ere this drear night was over leapt awake <br>
with ejaculations, in a language I do not understand. <br>
The lamp beside my bed was bright as day, <br>
God enthroned was captured in a little wooden frame, <br>
the window was open, the wind was grieving <br>
when morning came. <br>
</p>
