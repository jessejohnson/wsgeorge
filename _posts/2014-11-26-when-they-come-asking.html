<p class="content-text">	
It's been a while since I talked <br>
to someone who wanted to listen, <br>
told them of all the useless <br>
things I think of to fill the time, <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
those days have long since dogeared,<br>
there are vignettes on the edges <br>
of the frame, rust, rat bites, <br>
the colours aren't vivid anymore. <br>
Except the smiles, <br>
those will last a while, I think, <br>
before they too are rubbed <br>
off by neglect. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
It's the same thing that happens <br>
when I'm forgotten. <br>
I see my finger tips grow lighter, <br>
feel less, <br>
I see a little less light each morning, <br>
or the sun moves a few feet farther, <br>
or the earth drifts away.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
I hear a little less too, <br>
speak more softly than I used to,<br>
think a lot more, rather,<br>
and speak in short syllables.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
But now I barely whisper; <br>
you'll have to taste the air <br>
right from my lips to know what I'm saying.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
This poem will end soon also, <br>
because the mind from which it comes<br>
falters, drifts away into empty space<br>
where planets are for company<br>
that come by once in a few hundred years<br>
to say hello accompanied by<br>
consort moons that look and wonder why<br>
one must fly alone - their<br>
courtesies count for something more than yours,<br>
I'll swear.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">
If they ever come asking, tell them I<br>
was never there, that I'm that whisper<br>
lingering in the air, and you,<br>
you are responsible for this poem.<br>
