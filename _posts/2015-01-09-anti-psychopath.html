	I'm not a psychopath. Far from it.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	This morning on the BBC, a gentleman was on air talking about psychopathy and Capitalism.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	The interviewee was of the view that capitalism rewards psychopathic characteristics in individuals; from reckless risk-taking to ruthless wrangling in boardrooms and on the market. Archetypes of Wall Street strong men and the great tycoons of tech and industry were thrown about to illustrate this all-too familiar point. Among other odd occupations that offered the chance for psychopaths to excell were the priesthood and journalism.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	If my memory serves me right, this gentleman was Jon Ronson, the author of "The Psychopath Test: A Journey Through the Madness Industry", a popular book on the spectrum of characteristics psychologists use to describe psychopathy. He had come to the studio armed with facts, figures and an eleven-question test for the interviewer and all listeners. I opened a new tab in my text editor and listened to the instructions.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I was to answer each question with an integer; 3 if I strongly agreed, 2 if I agreed, 1 if I disagreed and 0 if I strongly disagreed. The sum of all these indicated if I was more psychopathic (higher number) or less psychopathic (lower number).
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I scored 0.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I don't know what to make of this. If one thing's certain, I won't be a great CEO anytime soon. So much for such ambitions.
