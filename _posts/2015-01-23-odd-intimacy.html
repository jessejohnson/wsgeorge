<p class="content-text">
	I had an intense philosophical discussion with two of my co-founders about the ugly side of social media and the appropriate response from a person who is overcome by peer pressure caused by Facebook and its ilk. During this discussion, I let out a little well-known secret, one I hadn't fully come to terms with yet. The most important thing for me in this life was friendship. Seeing people's signs of friendship on social media reminded me of what I didn't have, and that made me sad.

<p class="content-text">
	Explaining my stance (changing your environment - getting rid of social media, instead of changing your self and adapting, to cope with social media stress) may have won me the argument. My friend who was facing the dilemma chose, however, to side with the stance that was more generous to society: give Facebook a month and see if you won't find it needful.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	A fair choice, I say. Earlier that morning, I had already entrenched my position by deleting my WhatsApp so I could avoid certain persons who were beginning to have a negative effect on my life. To some I may have succumbed to social pressures and given up on the good technology-enabled communication brings. But to me, I was making a brave move by boldly shedding that which caused me pain. I have done this in other areas of my life...including cutting people off temporarily or permanently. It has served me well so far.

<p class="content-text">
	Yesterday, we had an off day at work. Everyone was stressed out. We needed a break from hacking to chill and do stuff. My work mates eased off with conversations with their SOs (as the Internet likes to call those people) while I...I did some more hacking on a little side project.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I spent the evening at choir rehearsal, my first this year. We learned the Sixth Chandos Anthem. The rest of the night was spent in my room, quietly ignoring my roommate and just doing Jesse stuff.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	This morning, I felt utterly alone in the world.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	The malady that was affecting my team had not lifted. This time, my CEO was down. My CTO stayed away. My co-CPO was having major issues with some code. As was I. The stress was evident on his face. His eyes were red and watering, his gaze lit by his laptop screen, was absent. My CEO was lying on a mattress on the floor at the back of our office. Sales had spent him completely.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Then his girlfriend called him. They talked a bit. She was concerned. He had been to hospital that morning. She said she'll come over. My co-CPO's girlfriend called too, worried about him. They talked a little. He seemed okay after that.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	A few minutes later, my CEO's girlfriend came in. She had come from work to be with him, to help him manage the stress. She's still with him as I type this.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	What about me?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	The only friends I count are in Kumasi. They're not really close friends, but right now they're all that matter to me. There's two of them. Mabel and Jermaine. They can only do so much though...they have lives they live. I am not as endowed with loving people as my co-founders.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Then a wild thought came into my mind as I sunk into the existential gloom that often plagues me day and night: why don't I just listen to some music? It had been a while since I listened from my collection of madrigals and serious pieces.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I loaded up my play-list with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD5TG8z3-SM" target="_blank">Third Tune from Thomas Tallis</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agNMQ3FtwBk" target="_blank">Crown of Roses from Tchaikovsky</a>, I threw in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFsmjMA0rK4" target="_blank">One Year Six Months from Yellow Card</a> (imagine!) and then <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BECZDIuqEvA" target="_blank">Corelli's</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7v8zxoEoA_Q" target="_blank">Vivaldi's</a> variations on La Follia. I hit play and let myself fall into the embrace of true love.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Right now I am listening to Vivaldi's brutally brilliant variations. In the moment La Follia began, I felt like I had met one person I truly trusted and could share myself with completely, without fear of betrayal or death. Were I alone, I would have wept with thanks.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	There's this intimacy that can only be felt in the heart. I felt it while I listened. My spirit was lifted higher and higher. I rose from depressed and alone to some height I cannot describe with words. Only with music. The joy was holy, spiritual. Divine.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	As I type this, the gloom has lifted from the fold. But I am not in the same plane as my co-founders. I am somewhere else. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klPZIGQcrHA" target="_blank">Handel's own Sarabande</a> variation of La Follia is leading me down a grassy lane on a moonlit night. We are alone, talking about ourselves in whispers. Being ourselves. Being in love. Communicating our deepest fears and desires. We are two independent voices making harmony in the silence of the night. The chords are grand, tinged with hope and sadness, afflicted by despair but triumphant.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Music is the only salvation I know.
