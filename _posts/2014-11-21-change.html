<p class="content-text">	
Great gifts must last forever, <br>
that is what I heard you say; <br>
but both of us will surely know <br>
the wind of life blows to and fro <br>
and nothing stays the same. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
Good things are hard to come by <br>
it is generally agreed; <br>
but chance will often look to dare <br>
or fate may flaunt its destined fare <br>
so nothing stays the same. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
The worst will surely happen <br>
that is what the wise men think; <br>
and life, obedient in that light <br>
must make reply against some slight <br>
to drive the world insane. <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
All men are slightly crazy, <br>
it is every doctor's creed; <br>
the theory has a certain ring <br>
for madness is a fickle thing <br>
and we are both insane <br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
But did those dreams have meaning? <br>
that is what the worried ask;<br>
your mind will play a trick or two<br>
and lace with lies what must be true<br>
to drive you raving mad.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
What use are premonitions?<br>
Is the riddle that is posed;<br>
Men like to search the hidden signs,<br>
of life's intelligent design:<br>
the truth will leave them mad.<br>
</p>

<p class="content-text">	
The world is always changing<br>
that is what the hopeful say;<br>
for both of us must surely know<br>
the wind of life blows to and fro<br>
so nothing stays the same.<br>
</p>
