	I finished Milton's epic yesterday afternoon and I had little else to do. Throughout my reading a thought kept coming back to me. The text I was reading did not feel like a great example of literature as it is usually considered. It took on a deeper significance than merely the scholarly. It was a spiritual exercise. I felt that Milton's work, though considered great for its literary merit is being done a huge disservice if we leave it just at that. I am reminded of Richard Dawkins' call for the Bible to be read in all English schools as an example of great literature. <br> <br>

	The same has been done to Paradise Lost. The poem, however, is much more than great literature. It is scripture.

<p class="content-text">
	If Merriam Webster is right, a Gospel is "the message concerning Christ, the kingdom of God, and salvation". Usually limited by Christian tradition to include just those four canonical Gospels and by scholars to include several texts that did not make it into the canon, this definition perfectly describes the poem I just read. The central idea of Paradise Lost is the message concerning Christ, God's Kingdom and salvation. Although the focus is on Lucifer's fall and the subsequent fall of man, Milton uses his epic to teach the message of Christ and his salvation. It is by far more dramatic than what the canonical books of the Bible tell us and in several important ways more relevant to today's intellectual society than those good old books. <br><br>

	And what is to say that Paradise Lost cannot be considered scripture? It was written by a man inspired by God, just as the rest of the accepted Bible. It is a text that has endured history and has become significant even as most of the Bible loses its significance today. Milton's only error was not writing this text before the books we know today were accepted as biblical canon.

<p class="content-text">
	Where the Bible fails in exploring the nature of Lucifer, Paradise Lost excels. The only other texts I remember that do the devil justice is the Book of Job, but it is scant. Throughout the Bible we are bothered with the troublesome history of Israel, the judges, kings and prophets, the life of Christ and then the thoughts on theology given us by his disciples. All is well and good, but how believable is the enemy is is continually perceived as some destructive angel, perpetual antagonist of God and His Christ; a largely two dimensional villain? Even Tolkien does better to describe evil. This may have been enough to carry the significance of the Gospel in years before, but now it fails entirely, or it is extremely weak. <br><br>

	I have never understood the motives of Lucifer more. I have never listened to his arguments and had the chance to see things from his point of view. Thanks to my more than casual reading of Paradise Lost, Lucifer became at once more real to me. His own twisted ideology of freedom is a strong argument; one that humanity makes boldly even today. But in it are the seeds of pride and sin God abhors. The Bible (in my limited reading) always showed one side of the argument but Milton is more thorough. He makes it easier for the keen mind to understand those things the Bible flatly communicates and appreciate and more importantly, believe them. <br><br>

	No message has greater need for believability than the Gospel and good writers are needed to make this possible. We do not need the shallow nonsense of many Christian texts. We need more Miltons.

	Milton does well to explore the nature of God and his angels, of Christ and man. Whereas the poem begins with an extensive focus on Lucifer and his peers, Milton excels at making God a relevant participant in our history. He doesn't stop at Almighty and Immortal. Those words are empty words, robbed of meaning and significance, tired from common use. Christ is watered down in other texts. Writers for a long time just leave him as the Son of God and nothing more. Milton goes further, not only telling us who he is, but allowing us to see his awe-some power. <br><br>

	Strong evidence of this can be seen in the three-day war in Heaven. The angels overpower Lucifer and his rebels on the first day. The rebels gather and their charismatic leader inspires them (and my! Lucifer is great with words!) and leads them to invent new engines of war with which to defeat the angels sent against them. With a smaller army, Lucifer wins the second day through deception and surprise; a tactic in conflict we know very well.<br><br>

	But then we see God intervene, acknowledging that this war will go on forever with the evenly matched powers. He lets us know that the Son was been handed the victory already, and sends him from his throne to drive the rebels out. The onslaught of Christ has a profound effect on the mind. Seeing him appear in his father wrath and drive Lucifer (erstwhile victorious) out of Heaven in a single maneuver is amazing. We are brought very close to the power of God and the fruitlessness of revolt against him no matter how wise Lucifer's arguments are. <br><br>

	We also witness the stern justice of God.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Too often the justice of God is numbed by his mercy. Christian preachers of today have lost the skill it takes to show us what the justice of a monarch really looks like. Milton shows us that God is terrible in anger, and his justice is harsh and complete. He doesn't seem at all the goodly Father we mistake him to be. He is a king, his word is law. Treason is met with death. That is all. <br><br>

	Our only hope comes through the Son. It is the Son who pleads for us, shows us love where the Father's terrible justice will judge us. Too often we take grace for granted. None of us will wear sack cloth for our sins. But only if we knew how terrible God was in anger...
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Milton makes this real to me, and more, relevant. For once in several years I have seen how crucial Christ is to the believer. He no longer is an afterthought "...through Christ our Lord, Amen" at the end of prayer. He is the only hope of escaping judgment.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Milton's Paradise Lost deserves more than a mere literary treatment. It is as human and divine as the rest of the Bible's accepted canon. Despite the writer's own faults and biases we see here a message of the Gospel more relevant than has been published before it. <br><br>

	Paradise Lost is a Gospel for the modern world.
