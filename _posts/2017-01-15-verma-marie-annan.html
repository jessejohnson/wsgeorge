	<span class="miniature">C</span>heryl overheard it first, <br>
	but thought it unlikely <br>
	that the poor girl, <br>
	whose name was passed round the office floor <br>
	for the collection of sympathies <br>
	was you, and so <br>
	she texted me. But my phone <br>
	was in my back pocket. Silent. <br>
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	I replied four hours later.
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	Cheryl was not sure <br>
	how to break the news <br>
	when she made certain <br>
	that the poor girl, <br>
	whose life was summed <br> 
	as “one more victim" <br>
	of Korle Bu’s cold concern <br>
	was you, so she teased me until I, <br> 
	impatient as I since have not been, <br>
	texted you for answers. <br>
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	You have not replied.
</p>
<p class="content-text">
	You are decaying in a coffin <br>
	in a place I will not know, <br>
	keeping those answers <br>
	because I was four weeks late. <br>
</p>
