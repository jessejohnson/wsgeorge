	I have had a thrilling year with many people, but as things change the new becomes old and retires. The old becomes new. People walk in and out of rooms. Cobwebs get cleaned up. We have makeovers. Sometimes the entire building is pulled down and a new one built on the foundation. Sometimes the ruin becomes an attraction.

<p class="content-text">
	For a while I've felt like the last. Things haven't been as blissful as one had hoped. There's two things I've learned this year. Hope is a drug worse than religion. It doesn't need one to subscribe to arcane belief systems nor does it require intricate rites and such. All you need to be afflicted by hope is to be human. Killing hope means killing a bit of humanity in us.

	Which is what intend to do.

	The other thing I've learned is, none of us matters, really. I don't, you don't. We just happen to be, we collide like atoms do in a mundane thing called matter. Some stick together for a while. Most bounce off in opposite directions. Life is like that. One is better off detached from it and fixated on oneself. I have learned this.

	In the coming months, I will transition from a world online to the real world. I've had enough of the people who live in my 15 inch screen. I need to disconnect and reconnect. I have some work to complete first, after which it will be goodbye to a lot of people I've come to know and hello to all the wonderful misfits of the world.

	I don't have much battery power left. I'll have to upload this post so I better end here. If you really need to reach me, wait.
