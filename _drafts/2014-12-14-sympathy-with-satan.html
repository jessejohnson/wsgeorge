	After years of avoiding Milton's Paradise Lost, I picked up the old poem two nights ago.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	I still remember one afternoon reading a blog post by a writer whose opinion I shared. I forget her name, or the name of the site; this happened over four years ago. Her argument was that poetry should look back to its more colourful eras and take back rhyme and metre and form. She argued for the old style and I, for the most part, agreed with her. Except she noted one exception: Paradise Lost was a snooze fest. God knows what disservice she had done to me.

	The thought of reading Milton's epic has haunted me for a while. But my interest in its subjects has grown since I took up Dan Brown's Inferno and then The Lost Symbol. It was the latter book (which I am still reading) that finally convinced me to pick up the poem. Brown's reference to Moloch, an angel in the epic (which was also the name I gave to my antagonist in my longest running project) convinced me that Paradise Lost will be crucial to my appreciation of certain things Christian, non-Christian and literary.

	This has been the best decision I've made in a long time.

	I'm just beginning Book IV but already my mind is overflowing with ideas from the text. And some powerful revelations too. The most obvious from the first two books is the disturbingly human nature of Satan. I believe the genius in Milton's work is casting the characters in this ancient myth in more human garments. Unlike God who is infinitely good and perfect and doesn't stand to be an interesting subject in terms of character development, Satan is remarkable.

<p class="content-text">
	From the beginning we learn not only of his crimes but of his motives. He echoes the words of Caesar when he admits that it is better to be king in this place than subservient to God in Heaven. Most striking is his compassion towards his fellow rebels: Satan still has a virtuous heart, though it is set against God. He doesn't represent a mindless destructive force but rather, an illegal alternative. Satan also has a belief in liberty as strong as the Founders of America may have had. He values “hard liberty” over "servile pomp", a sentiment shared by many rebellious teenagers and Freedom Fighters.

	Satan, although the antagonist in this narrative is cast in an almost noble light one would think Milton was making his case.
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	Milton however betrays overflowing adoration towards God and all things high and holy. After all, he is Christian. The best argument for free will of man and angels is made by God; an argument I have never seen in my entire life of Christian study and debate. In a nutshell, what use is our worship if it is hardwired in us? Will it please God to make stooges that know how to sing his praise alone? Is it not far better for him to give us the choice to love or hate him, and watch us run to him with love and thanks? Won't it give us some merit too, that we freely chose to love him?
</p>

<p class="content-text">
	In many ways, Milton's Paradise Lost is the most important religious text I have read. It may be the most crucial Christian text to be published in English, if I had it my way. I feel my faith being stoked once more.
