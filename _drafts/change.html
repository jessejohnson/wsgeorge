Great gifts must last forever,
that is what I heard you say;
but both of us will surely know
the wind of life blows to and fro
and nothing stays the same.

Good things are hard to come by
it is generally agreed;
but chance will often look to dare
or fate may flaunt its destined fare
so nothing stays the same.

The worst will surely happen
that is what the wise men think;
and life, obedient in that light
must make reply against some slight
to drive the world insane.

All men are slightly crazy,
it is every doctor's creed;
the theory has a certain ring
for madness is a fickle thing
and we are both insane

But did those dreams have meaning?
that is what the worried ask;
your mind will play a trick or two
and lace with lies what must be true
to drive you raving mad.

What use are premonitions?
Is the riddle that is posed;
Men like to search the hidden signs,
of life's intelligent design:
the truth will leave them mad.

The world is always changing
that is what the hopeful say;
for both of us must surely know
the wind of life blows to and fro
so nothing stays the same.
