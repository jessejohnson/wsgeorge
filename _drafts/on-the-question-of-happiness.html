On The Question of Happiness

Beginning such a text is not easy. I've no idea what I want to write about, how long and in-depth its contents should be, or what exactly I want to tell you. All that fills my head are fragments of philosophy, music, some personal convictions all woven with a theme of happiness. I know what this should be about, but I fumble on the opening words. I wish I could be more profound but, as I have neither the wealth of experience of the clarity that comes with a strong epiphany, as I have no academic coherence with which to convey these thoughts, let me just begin with by declaring quite triumphantly that at this moment, I am happy.

Happiness has eluded me for a long time. In the last six months or so, I have lived under a spell as powerful as the only a desperate mind can cast: that I could make my own happiness. Nearly four months ago I fell into depression that lasted seven days. Old resolves were weakened and I succumbed to an addiction I still am not comfortable declaring to the public. In the brief moment when my affliction was complete, I found solace in the words of one blogger [30 Sleeps]. He reassured me that no one truly cared about me, my life, my thoughts. That I had no worth to anyone but myself. No one cared if I were happy, sad, fulfilled or dead. Life moved on.

Finding strength in a personal development blog, I picked up the pieces and moved on with my life, determined to find happiness in myself and the things I loved. Which meant poetry and sometimes software. But mostly poetry.

For four months I indulged in some of the best literature English has managed to produce. From long nights reading Plath to Kafka, Carroll and Rowling, I was in some sort of make-belief paradise. Storytellers will call this suspension of disbelief. It's meant to last the length of the novel, or whatever work of fiction was in question. My suspension of disbelief lasted weeks without end, only ever punctuated by brief episodes of anxiety from work and some drama my super-charged writing produced. But that is another story.

For a while I strongly believed that I could find true happiness in certain things I loved. When work was not there to distract me, there was music. I discovered the depth of beauty Mozart worked into his Requiem by singing this mass with a parish choir on the University of Ghana campus. I wrote poetry. A little of it, but I spent far more time reading works from the masters than throwing in my own mediocre fare. For the most part I was glad.

But, like all enchantments, the magic begins to wear and, sometimes with graceful degradation but often (like it was in my case) an unanticipated collapse, everything falls apart.

This happened to me probably two or three weeks ago. I don't care to remember. On one wild Friday night all cloaks of happiness I'd held up fell off. On one night I moved from a happy individual living life to the fullest to a man lost in pensive solitude. My night was restless. For some reason I felt extremely empty. I needed something more from life than I'd let myself believe I had already. Something was wrong. The music had stopped. The lights dimmed, curtains fallen. The show was over.

That weekend will be remembered as one of my most dramatic. I drugged myself to sleep and woke up the next night, feeling much worse than I could ever have. Sunday was spent in bed, cursing my lot. By Monday I was at home, Tuesday saw me in my parish priest's office being prayed over. My world collapsed on Wednesday. I died that evening.

Tonight, I'm alone in my room. I've just finished watching two short documentaries on two philosophers. The first, Epicurus, I'd learned of last week. The second, Montaigne, only just now. Let's talk a bit about Epicurus first.

Now I don't recollect exactly where I saw this, but one blogger summed up some of the Greek philosopher's teaching about happiness and life in a metaphor. He described life as a party, and admonished that we learn to enjoy it. Through several images, he illustrated some very charming points about life and how it should be lived. What I remember (because it had a lot to do with the cause of my present episode of depression and the drama that came with it) was one must learn to dance with people at the party that is life. And when they find other interesting dance partners, we should let them go and find ourselves the next.

In my poetry I use 'dance' a lot to represent relationships we make with people. One poem that's still my favourite begins

If we could,
let us dance just once
as graceful birds,

where I beg another persons hand for a short dance before "the night runs out" and we are discovered. You get what I'm driving at. It was no surprise that this metaphor struck such a powerful chord with me. The words leapt at me and I saw the wisdom of Epicurus.

That was why I did not let this short documentary about his philosophy of happiness pass me by. I knew this guy was legit. I trusted Epicurus. The object of this documentary was to speak critically against our consumerist society. For one not overcome by the want for more things (because I have little interest, nor the means to purchase all of my hearts desires) much of the narrative did not matter to me. Afterall, I am not plagued by the desire to shop till I'm happy. I know material things cannot give me true happiness. I am a poet, and well beyond such thinking.

Alain de Botton, writer of this documentary summarised Epiricus' teaching on happiness in three fundamental things that as humans we need the most. The first was Friendship. The second, Freedom. The third, Reflection.

The irony of this simplification was, the narrator assumed that the first step to happiness is the simplest. Friends. We need friends, not products. One can only imagine the pain that shot through me when he let out the simple secret. Friends. Not products. I am not in need of products. I am in need of friends. The well meaning Alain assumed that most people in pursuit of happiness have got the answer right around them. I do not blame him for thinking that way. I realise I am a peculiar case.

I have no friend. I don't mean to suggest I am without people to look at and talk to. No, not at all. I am surrounded by acquaintances, critics and sympathizers. Most of these are easy to find: the 60 or so people I work with, my roommate, random Internet persons on Reddit and the people I used to chat with on social media. Those people are not friends.

I don't count family also. Family plays a very unique role in my life, and for that I am thankful. But family does not play the same role as friends do. Or should do, in my case, were thay available. In the last three years, I can count two attempts at friendship and one partnership that's lasted quite a while. I am cordial with my photobuddy, but he's found more acceptance in Ghana's local photography community (they call themselves Photogbeis) and I have more or less withdrawn from those circles. One friendship with a writer I hoped will be fruitful was shattered weeks ago. It was mostly my own fault and I accept all blame that comes with it. But that does not change the status quo: I am without a friend.

Already I am lacking in one of Epiricus' fundamental human needs that guarantee happiness. Of freedom, I have to a certain degree. I am not from a dirt poor family. My career path is uncertain (tech entrepreneur) but employment prospects are quite good. I am fairly well connected to not lack the basic luxuries in life. I don't live an expensive life, I should add. My meagre stipend is more than enough to take care of me, so I'm more or less covered when it comes to freedom. Reflection is second nature to me. I thankfully am not one of those dimwitted extroverts who live life tooting a horn and only go quiet when put to bed or dead. I write poetry. I reflect a lot on life. Probably more than I should, but that's beside the point.

If Epiricus is anything to go by, there is one thing I need in life. It's friendship. Let's be more specific. Companionship. As I sit here, typing out this essay (it's long enough to merit that now) I can think of no one I could approach to share my thoughts with ~ besides you of course, but you are an anonymous reader. I have no one outside my family who cares for the things I care about. I have no one outside my family whose concerns are my concerns. There's no one I can mention who tells me how their day was, what sucked and what didn't. I don't have anyone to share my dreams with. I share in no ones life. No one asks me how I am.

This has been the case most of my life. Oh, you might say, you're just exaggerating. Had you no friends you should have turned into a psychopath by now.

Who's to say I'm not?

The sunniest years of my life were before I moved to a new city and a new school. Those years I had a friend. One friend. I called him my best friend. For five or six years everyone knew both of us rolled together. Last I heard of him was four years ago on Facebook. He was in Dartmouth College and he couldn't even remember who I was.

From junior high through to senior high, I got close to a number of people because of the things we shared. One gentleman wanted to be a writer as badly as I had. We both loved fantasy books. We wrote together and shared our stories. He gave up writing in senior high and has since become a medical doctor with medical doctor friends and all. My years in high school were spent with another guy who was a fan of guns and planes and sciency stuff. Our friendship was over after school. Another friend who profoundly affected my writing life has moved on. Despite several attempts to get back to old times, each person I used to know has found a way of continuing with their lives, leaving me to look back on those days and ask, "why are they all leaving?"

That's a question that has haunted me for years. When I look around, I see people form cliques, share secrets, be together and be generally happy in each other's presence. I see all this because I'm not preoccupied by my own relationships. I get the chance to sit on the fence and look at them all. When trouble comes, the people around me have someone they can go to. I get no one. The only times I seem to have mattered in a group situation was when I had something everyone else wanted. Like how, in French class, people would fight for the chance to be grouped with me because I was the best in class.

They never did it because I was me. No one ever came to me because I was me. And the few that ever stopped to say hello, they found companions better than myself and they moved on. All of them moved on. I know this, because I have no one to talk to except the wind. Or myself.

It's funny how happiness gets old quickly. Moments ago I was beaming. Now, I'm pensive. Life has asked the question again: "Why are they leaving?"

I have no answer.
