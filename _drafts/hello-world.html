Welcome to my blog.

If you found this site, you may be wondering what happened to the five or so blogs I run on WordPress and Blogger. I've killed all of them and moved on, for several reasons.

You will find all of my content here. The blog section is where, from time to time, I will share my thoughts on poetry and writing in general, as I used to do on SeriousPoetry. My poems, previously on my blogger site, will be published here.

I will create new sections of my site for the other kinds of post ~ short fiction, essays and a list of my published work.

I've got some content up already, so read through if you have the time.
